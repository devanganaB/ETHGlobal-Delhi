# Solv3  

## ðŸ’¡ Idea  
Solv3 is a Web3-based coding platform that makes daily coding practice and contests fun, competitive, and rewarding. Users stake tokens to join contests, winners earn from the pool, and all participants have a chance to win NFTs with special powers. AI agents also analyze coding profiles, generate questions, and guide users in real-time.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Foundry** â€“ Smart contract development and testing  
- **Ethers.js** â€“ Blockchain interactions from the frontend  
- **Node.js** â€“ Backend servers and API integration  
- **Fetch.ai** â€“ AI agents for question generation and profile analysis  
- **ASI One** â€“ Real-time interaction with hosted AI agents  

## ðŸ”‘ Pyth Network  
We use **Pyth Networkâ€™s entropy** extensively for randomness across the platform. This ensures fair question generation, unbiased winner selection, and transparent NFT rewards. All outcomes are verifiable and trustless.  

## ðŸ¤– ASI One  
Through **ASI One integration**, users can interact directly with AI agents built on Fetch.ai. These agents provide real-time assistance, coding insights, and personalized guidance, making the learning process engaging and interactive.
